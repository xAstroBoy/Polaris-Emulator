# Polaris

**Polaris** is a complete, self-contained hotel package: a modern Java game
server (formerly known as *Arcturus Morningstar Extended*), the Octane browser
client, a ready-to-import database and all the assets needed to bring a hotel
online.

Polaris originated as a fork of [Arcturus Community](https://git.krews.org/morningstar/Arcturus-Community).

Since then, Polaris has evolved beyond its origins. The emulator has been expanded, improved and maintained through numerous fixes and new features.

While Polaris remains grateful to the Arcturus project and its contributors, it is no longer intended to be a simple fork. It is an independently developed platform with its own identity, technical direction and long-term vision.

## Requirements

- **Emulator:** Java 21 (JDK) and Maven
- **Database:** MariaDB

## Quick start

### 1. Database

Create an empty MariaDB database and put its name and credentials in
`config.ini`. Polaris creates the schema automatically on first startup; you do
not need to import a database dump.

Already running an Arcturus Morningstar 3.5.5 or older Polaris hotel? **Make a
full database backup first**, point Polaris at that database, and start the
emulator. A recognized hotel is adopted and upgraded automatically while its
users, rooms, items, currencies, settings, and custom tables are preserved.
Polaris refuses to modify a non-empty database that does not look like an
Arcturus/Polaris hotel.

Automatic migrations are enabled by default. Advanced deployments can set
`db.migrate.on_startup=false` (or `DB_MIGRATE_ON_STARTUP=false`) after applying
migrations separately.

Deployment and troubleshooting commands:

```bash
# Apply migrations and exit without starting the hotel
java -jar Polaris-<version>-jar-with-dependencies.jar --migrations-only

# Read-only compatibility, checksum and pending-migration report
java -jar Polaris-<version>-jar-with-dependencies.jar --migrations=validate
```

`--migrations=apply` explicitly applies migrations before normal startup. There
is no interactive startup prompt, because that would hang Docker, systemd and
hosting-panel restarts.

### 2. Game server

```
cd emulator
mvn package
```

The build produces `target/Polaris-<version>-jar-with-dependencies.jar`.
Place a `config.ini` with your database credentials next to the jar (or set
the `DB_HOSTNAME`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_DATABASE`, `DB_USERNAME` and `DB_PASSWORD`
environment variables) and start it with:

```
java -jar Polaris-<version>-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```

## Plugins & backwards compatibility

Polaris keeps its promise to existing plugin authors:

- Plugin jars built for Arcturus/Morningstar **load unchanged** — the Java API
  still lives in the `com.eu.habbo.*` packages.
- Raw SQL written against pre-Polaris table names is translated on the fly by
  the **legacy bridge**. The best-known example: the old `permissions` table
  is now split into `permission_ranks` and `permission_definitions`, and the
  bridge rewrites old-style statements (such as
  `ALTER TABLE permissions ADD cmd_x ...`) into their new-schema equivalents
  automatically.

How it works, what it covers and how to configure it is documented in
[`POLARIS.md`](POLARIS.md).
