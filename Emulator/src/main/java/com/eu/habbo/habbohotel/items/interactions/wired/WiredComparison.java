/**
 * Comparison operators for wired chest conditions.
 *
 * <p>The integer encoding is the WIRE CONTRACT shared with the client
 * ({@code ui/src/components/wired/views/WiredComparisonOperator.tsx}) and the
 * official deobfuscated {@code ChestHasAmount}. It must be mapped by VALUE, never
 * by ordinal:
 *
 * <pre>0 = &lt;    1 = =    2 = &gt;    3 = &lt;=    4 = !=    5 = &gt;=</pre>
 *
 * The default ({@code >=}) preserves the chest conditions' historical hard-coded
 * behaviour for saves written before the operator existed.
