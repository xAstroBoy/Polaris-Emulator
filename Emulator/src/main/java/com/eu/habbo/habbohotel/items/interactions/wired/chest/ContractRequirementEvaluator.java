/**
 * Decides whether what a player has put on the table satisfies a contract, and which alternative it
 * satisfies.
 *
 * <p>The two halves of a rule are checked differently, the way the official window behaves. Furni has
 * to be <strong>offered</strong> — physically dragged into the trade grid, so the player sees exactly
 * which of their items is about to leave. Currency is not draggable; it is checked against the wallet
 * and taken at confirmation. A rule mixing both is satisfied only when both halves are.
 *
 * <p>Alternatives are tried in order and the first satisfied one wins, so the owner's ordering is the
 * priority: put the cheapest option first and that is the one a player pays.
 *
 * <p>Deliberately free of emulator types: it takes a wallet lookup and a flat list of offered items,
 * which keeps the whole decision unit-testable without a running hotel.
