-- Convert marketplace_items to InnoDB so a marketplace purchase can use
-- row locks and rollback when the Java transaction refactor lands. MyISAM
-- supports neither; this migration enables atomicity but does not provide it alone.
-- The table ships as MyISAM ROW_FORMAT=FIXED; InnoDB rejects ROW_FORMAT=FIXED, so
-- the row format is reset in the same statement.
-- Guarded: only rebuilds when not already InnoDB. Small table (listings), so the
-- brief write-block of a COPY rebuild is acceptable.
